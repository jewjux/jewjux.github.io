						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>From this article, I learned that "dark patterns" are manipulative design tactics used in UX/UI to deceive users into actions that aren't in their best interest, often for corporate gain. These tactics exploit human psychology and are not merely poor design choices but are instead intentionally crafted to mislead. The concept was first identified and named by Harry Brignull in 2010, and these manipulations have evolved from obvious tricks to more sophisticated and sneaky interactions that even informed users may struggle to recognize.</p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>My favorite part of the article was the detailed exploration of the types of dark patterns, along with real-world examples that make the abstract concept more tangible and understandable. For instance, the explanation of the “Bait and Switch” and “Forced Continuity” patterns sheds light on common but unethical practices that many might have experienced but not recognized as intentional designs to manipulate.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>A quote that stood out to me was by Harry Brignull, who defined dark patterns as “a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills.” This quote is compelling because it succinctly captures the essence of dark patterns and emphasizes the deliberate nature of these manipulative design choices.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p>I would rate my enjoyment of reading this article as a 9. It was enlightening to learn about the ethical challenges within design practices, particularly in how they can influence user behavior in ways that users themselves may not be aware of. The only reason I wouldn't rate it a perfect 10 is that the subject matter itself is quite disheartening, knowing such manipulation is commonplace in design.</p>
