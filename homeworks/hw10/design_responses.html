							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>This article provides a comprehensive look at the psychological principles behind visual attention and how these can be applied in UX design, making it a valuable resource for designers looking to enhance user engagement. The discussion of different types of attention—selective, divided, focused, and sustained—and their implications for design was particularly insightful. Examples such as the "Cocktail Party Effect" in digital environments and the application of Hick's Law to interface design clearly illustrate how understanding cognitive functions can lead to more effective UX designs. This piece effectively bridges the gap between psychological theory and practical application, affirming the importance of psychology in design.</p>
