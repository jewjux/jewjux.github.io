							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>From this article, I learned about the intricate balance required in designing interface animations, focusing on the importance of duration, speed, and the natural movement of objects. It highlighted the significance of considering human perception and the physical laws in animation to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience. Moreover, the article emphasized the optimal speed range for interface animations, between 200 and 500 milliseconds, to maintain user engagement without causing delay or confusion.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the detailed explanation of easing techniques and how they contribute to making animations feel more natural and realistic. The discussion on ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out curves, including their appropriate applications within an interface, provided clear guidelines on how to effectively utilize these methods to enhance the user's interaction with the interface. This section demystified the principles behind smooth and appealing animations, making it accessible for designers to apply in their work. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "The animation in the interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction, acceleration, etc. Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
