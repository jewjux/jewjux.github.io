							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>From this article, I learned that the human brain seeks to organize and interpret visual information by applying previous experiences and visual patterns, a process fundamental to the principles of Gestalt psychology. This approach is critical in the field of User Interface (UI) design, as it informs how designers can manipulate visual elements to guide perception, focus attention, and ultimately influence behavior. The Gestalt principles, such as proximity, similarity, and continuity, help designers create interfaces that are intuitive and efficient, enhancing the user's experience by leveraging the brain's natural tendencies to group and interpret visual stimuli. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of the article was the explanation of the Gestalt principles and their application in UI design. It's fascinating to see how principles developed in the early 20th century remain relevant in the digital age, guiding the organization and presentation of information in a way that aligns with human perceptual tendencies. This connection between psychology and design underscores the importance of understanding human cognition to create effective and engaging interfaces.</p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception. What happens when someoneâ€™s eye meets your design creations? How does their mind react to the message your piece is sharing?"</p>
